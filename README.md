# Workplane

A small addon which adds a workplane like tool to blender.

The main idea is that it allows for quickly setting up a custom transform orientation, which is used for finding the major two axis the user is viewing - these can then be used as constraints for translate/rotate/scale operations without the need to type it in manually. So for example instead of "g" "Shift-Y" "Shift-Y" you can just do that with on command.

#Installation
Just enable the addon under 3D View > Workplane
