# Workplane

A small addon which adds a workplane like tool to blender.

The main idea is that it allows for quickly setting up a custom transform orientation, which is used for finding the major two axis the user is viewing - these can then be used as constraints for translate/rotate/scale operations without the need to type it in manually. So for example instead of "g" "Shift-Y" "Shift-Y" you can just do that with on command.

## Installation
Just enable the addon under 3D View > Workplane

The tools itself is under 3D View > Sidebar Tools > Workplane

## Usage
Just select something, and hit "set workplane" - a grid will show up, its a visualisation on what plane you would work on if you would start an transform operation.

Observe how the workplane adapts to the view
